This repository is our attempt to learn html

Scott - recent changes:
<ul>
  <li>made a CSS file that turns all the text red, looks pretty ugly lol but proof of concept using CSS</li>
  <li>made folders to hold CSS files, javascript files, and images we put into the webpage</li>
  <li>I downloaded the image of Paul then uploaded to the images folder so that we don't have to link to Kenyon in order to include the picture in the web page. 
  <li>changed index.md to index.html, this gives us full control over the whole html of the web page</li>
</ul>
